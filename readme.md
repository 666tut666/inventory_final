uvicorn main:app --reload
For the React app on the frontend (make sure you have the latest version of Node.js):

(src: "https://nodejs.org/en/download/" )

In the terminal, navigate to the frontend directory:

sh
Copy code
cd frontend
Install the required packages:

sh
Copy code
npm install
Run React:

sh
Copy code
npm start
If you receive an error on the frontend:

Delete the following directories:
/frontend/node_modules
/frontend/package-lock.json
Reinstall npm and run React.```
